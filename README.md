# Smart-patrolling-robot
Around the world, there is a lot of concern about the safety and welfare of people. Despite living in a technologically advanced world, crime rates are gradually increasing, as we have all witnessed. The patrolling robot aims to tackle this issue. Our system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect distance from objects and avoid them. The ultrasonic sensor attached to a servo motor detects the distances between objects and chooses the path with the longest distance. The proposed system use an ESP32 Ai-Thinker camera. The video recorded by it is live streamed to a specific IP- address. The proposed system can monitor the livestream with the IP-address.
